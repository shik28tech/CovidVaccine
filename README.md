# Covid-19 Vaccine Data

**The concept of the Project is to retrieve the data of Covid-19 vaccine(i.e. details of all centers and sessions at a particular area) using an API**


**I have implemented the above scenario using simple html and ajax call**


1. Firstly, as you run the project you need to enter the pincode of your area followed by current or future date.

2. Secondly, Click on the first button to get details of all centers and Click on second button to get details of all sessions scheduled at that particular center.


__Below are some images to show you some snippit of the project__
